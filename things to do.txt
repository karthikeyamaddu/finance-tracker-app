new things we need to add:
first is see why axis bank is not sending me sms when i do transaction using pop
second is make it dynamic, ie rather tyan predefining that use this sender, we can make it dynamic
and when we add a new sender, we can ask to give me a demo sms for us to understand how to parse information
and save into our app


thid and main thing is this, add a button which when clicked will open the apps whicha are used for upi tranactions 
we can maually enter which app to see, and when that button is clicked, it will open that app
and see all the tranactions we did on that day and save into our app
and when this is done, each transaction we should be able to see which app we have used


fourth, we can add a profile, and for export as csv, we can add this feature where we can send to email

everything is fine and working neatly till now
