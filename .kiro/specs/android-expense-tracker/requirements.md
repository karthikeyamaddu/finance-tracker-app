# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an Android expense tracking application that automatically captures UPI transactions from Axis Bank SMS messages and provides manual transaction entry capabilities. The app focuses on daily transaction labeling and management with a clean, modern interface that allows users to quickly categorize and track their financial transactions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Automatic SMS Transaction Capture

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to automatically capture my UPI transactions from Axis Bank SMS messages, so that I don't have to manually enter every transaction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an SMS is received from a sender matching the pattern "??-AXISBK-S" (where ?? = AD, JD, CP, etc.) THEN the system SHALL parse the SMS content automatically
2. WHEN parsing a DEBIT transaction SMS THEN the system SHALL extract amount, account number, date, time, receiver name, and UPI reference number
3. WHEN parsing a CREDIT transaction SMS THEN the system SHALL extract amount, account number, date, time, sender name, and UPI reference number
4. WHEN a transaction is successfully parsed THEN the system SHALL save it to the local database with entry_method as 'SMS'
5. WHEN a transaction is saved THEN the system SHALL display a notification to the user
6. IF the SMS format doesn't match expected patterns THEN the system SHALL ignore the SMS without processing

### Requirement 2: Manual Transaction Entry

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manually add transactions that weren't captured automatically, so that I have a complete record of all my expenses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user taps the floating action button THEN the system SHALL display a manual entry dialog
2. WHEN entering a manual transaction THEN the system SHALL provide fields for amount, transaction type, receiver/sender name, date, time, and tag
3. WHEN the user saves a manual transaction THEN the system SHALL store it with entry_method as 'MANUAL'
4. WHEN entering amount THEN the system SHALL validate it as a positive decimal number
5. WHEN selecting date and time THEN the system SHALL default to current date and time
6. IF required fields are missing THEN the system SHALL prevent saving and show validation errors

### Requirement 3: Transaction Labeling and Tagging

**User Story:** As a user, I want to add custom labels/tags to my transactions, so that I can categorize and organize my expenses effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any transaction THEN the system SHALL allow the user to add or edit a custom tag
2. WHEN a transaction has no tag THEN the system SHALL mark it as untagged (is_tagged = 0)
3. WHEN a user adds a tag to a transaction THEN the system SHALL update is_tagged to 1 and save the tag
4. WHEN displaying transactions THEN the system SHALL show the tag if present or indicate "Add Tag" if missing
5. WHEN saving a tag THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback with animations
6. IF a tag is empty or whitespace only THEN the system SHALL treat it as untagged

### Requirement 4: Home Screen Dashboard

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see today's transactions on the home screen, so that I can quickly review my daily spending activity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN opening the app THEN the system SHALL display today's transactions in chronological order (newest first)
2. WHEN displaying transactions THEN the system SHALL use red color for debits and green color for credits
3. WHEN a transaction is untagged THEN the system SHALL show an amber indicator
4. WHEN the user taps a transaction THEN the system SHALL open the transaction detail screen
5. WHEN displaying the home screen THEN the system SHALL show a time format toggle (24h/12h)
6. WHEN no transactions exist for today THEN the system SHALL show an appropriate empty state message

### Requirement 5: Transaction History Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view all my transaction history with search and filter capabilities, so that I can find specific transactions easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing transaction history THEN the system SHALL display all transactions grouped by month
2. WHEN searching transactions THEN the system SHALL filter by receiver/sender name or tag
3. WHEN applying filters THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by date range, transaction type, and tagged status
4. WHEN scrolling through history THEN the system SHALL implement infinite scroll for performance
5. WHEN viewing history THEN the system SHALL maintain the same color coding as the home screen
6. IF no transactions match search/filter criteria THEN the system SHALL show appropriate empty state

### Requirement 6: Untagged Transaction Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see all untagged transactions in one place, so that I can efficiently label transactions that need attention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing untagged transactions THEN the system SHALL display only transactions where is_tagged = 0
2. WHEN displaying untagged transactions THEN the system SHALL sort by date (newest first)
3. WHEN viewing untagged transactions THEN the system SHALL use amber/yellow accent colors to emphasize action needed
4. WHEN the user tags a transaction from this screen THEN the system SHALL remove it from the untagged list
5. WHEN no untagged transactions exist THEN the system SHALL show a congratulatory message
6. WHEN displaying the untagged count THEN the system SHALL show the number in the navigation

### Requirement 7: Notification System

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive notifications when new transactions are captured, so that I'm immediately aware of financial activity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new transaction is parsed from SMS THEN the system SHALL show a high-priority notification

6. IF notification permissions are denied THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle without crashing

### Requirement 8: Settings and Configuration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure app settings like time format and manage permissions, so that the app works according to my preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing settings THEN the system SHALL provide options for time format (24h/12h), notifications, and data export
2. WHEN toggling time format THEN the system SHALL immediately update all time displays throughout the app
3. WHEN checking permissions THEN the system SHALL show current SMS and notification permission status
4. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL generate a CSV file with all transaction data
5. WHEN managing permissions THEN the system SHALL provide clear explanations for why each permission is needed
6. IF permissions are revoked THEN the system SHALL handle gracefully and guide user to re-enable

### Requirement 9: Data Persistence and Security

**User Story:** As a user, I want my transaction data to be stored securely on my device, so that my financial information remains private and accessible offline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing transaction data THEN the system SHALL use local SQLite database with Room framework
